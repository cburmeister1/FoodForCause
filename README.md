## What does Food For Cause do for the community?

### Problem
* Kansas City does not have a resource to connect food suppliers and organizations that provide food stuffs to the community.

* Many grocery stores, and restaurants throw away food that could go to good use.
    * Some of these items will expire soon.
    * Others items may have damaged packaging or other small defects that do not affect the quality of the product, but the store is still unable to sell the items.
* Food banks and Kitchens provide a valuable service: feeding people in our community that need assistance and sustenance.
* A large amount of food is unnecessarily wasted.
* Our community needs food assistance programs to thrive and care for those in need.

### Solution
* Food For Cause provides a platform to connect local community outreach programs, like food banks and kitchens, with companies that have food to donate.
* This will help to reduce food waste, put the food to good use, and strengthen the community.

### How Does it work?
* Grocery Stores, restaurants, and other businesses post their available food items, quantity, and expiration dates.
* Food banks, and kitchens may reserve and pick up items.
* Unreserved items that are nearing expiration will be tweeted and text (SMS) to let the community know about their availability.
